"""
Pure parsing helpers for DEGIRO's /trading/secure/v5/update response shape.
Kept dependency-free (no fastapi/httpx) so it can be unit tested in isolation —
mirrors services/bourse-direct-auth/portfolio_parser.py.

The "value" array-of-{name, value}-pairs shape modeled here was reconstructed from
public reference implementations and has since been confirmed against a live
account. See docs/features/degiro-sync.md "Known limitations" for what remains open.

Completeness gate: a block, row or field this parser relies on that is missing or
non-numeric raises `PortfolioFormatError` instead of degrading to 0 / an empty list.
Java trusts the payload — it books `cash + Σ size × price` as the account value,
writes a daily snapshot and replaces every holding — so a reshaped DEGIRO response
must fail the sync, never silently value the account at 0 € (same discipline as
services/bourse-direct-auth/portfolio_parser.py).
