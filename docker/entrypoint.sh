# Picsou container entrypoint — "zero-config" secrets bootstrap.
#
# On first boot, generates the two secrets the app needs before Spring
# can even start (they're read at bean-construction time, so they cannot
# live in the DB):
#   • JWT_SECRET              → /data/.secrets/jwt_secret
#   • CRYPTO_ENCRYPTION_KEY   → /data/.secrets/crypto_key
#
# The database password is deliberately NOT generated here. Postgres
# initialises its role from the db service's own POSTGRES_PASSWORD before
# this container starts, so a value minted here could never reach it; the
# compose file derives SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD from the same
# ${POSTGRES_PASSWORD:-picsou} expression as the db service instead. (Older
# images wrote an unused /data/.secrets/postgres_password; it is ignored.)
#
# On subsequent boots, the files already exist on the /data volume, so we
# just re-export. A secret is **never** regenerated once created — doing
# so would invalidate every previously-issued JWT (users logged out) and
# every encrypted crypto API secret in the DB (permanent data loss).
#
# If the env var is already set (user-supplied via .env or an external
# secret manager), we respect it and skip generation entirely. That means
# existing installs upgrading to this image see zero behavior change.

#
# Opt-in rather than always-on because Picsou is commonly served with a
# locally-issued certificate (Caddy's internal CA via the `tls` compose
# profile, or mkcert). Sending HSTS with a certificate the browser does not
# trust is a one-way trap: the policy is remembered, the "proceed anyway"
# bypass disappears, and the user is locked out of their own app with no
# recovery short of clearing HSTS state in browser internals.
#
# Enable it only once the certificate is publicly trusted — i.e. the `tls`
# profile with a real domain (Let's Encrypt), or an upstream proxy holding a
# publicly-trusted cert.
