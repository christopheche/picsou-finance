# Feature: Real estate valuation

> Last updated: 2026-08-10

## Context

`REAL_ESTATE` accounts existed since V19 but were inert: a value typed in once that never
moved, with a metadata endpoint no client ever called. This feature makes a property describe
itself (Finary-parity field set), estimate its own current value from French open data, and
report gross/net equity against the mortgages financing it.

Everything runs on **unauthenticated, Licence Ouverte 2.0** sources — no API key, no signup,
no subscription. See [the ADR](../decisions/2026-08-01-open-data-property-valuation.md) for
why that constraint drove the whole design.

## How it works

### Flow

```
User saves the property form
   └─> PUT /accounts/{id}/real-estate
        └─> address changed? clear insee_code (forces a re-geocode)

Estimate (manual button, or monthly job)
   └─> PropertyValuationService.estimate(accountId, memberId)
        ├─ requireOwner            (a co-owner may not move the balance)
        ├─ kind estimable?         HOUSE / APARTMENT only  -> else NOT_ESTIMABLE
        ├─ living area present?                            -> else INCOMPLETE_DATA
        ├─ geocode if insee_code is null
        │     GeoplateformeGeocoder -> INSEE code, lat/lon, BAN id
        │     score < 0.4                                   -> GEOCODING_FAILED
        ├─ pick the first provider whose supports() accepts -> else UNSUPPORTED_AREA
        │     CeremaDv3fValuationProvider
        │       communes scale -> median €/m² x living area
        │       empty? fall back to departements, confidence forced LOW
        ├─ PropertyAdjustments      floor, lift, outdoor space, energy, garage, land
        │                           applied to the estimate *and* to the q25/q75 bounds
        ├─ InseeBdmIndexProvider    carry the DVF vintage forward to today
        ├─ upsert property_valuation on (account_id, today)
        └─ valuation_mode == ESTIMATED ? write account.currentBalance : leave it alone

Daily snapshot job (unchanged) picks up the new balance -> gain curve for free
```

### Key files

**Backend**
- `port/PropertyValuationPort.java` — estimation contract; `supports()` is how a provider
  declines an area it has no data for
- `port/GeocodingPort.java` — address → INSEE code (the join key for every price series)
- `port/HousingPriceIndexPort.java` — re-indexing ratio
- `adapter/CeremaDv3fValuationProvider.java` — DV3F market indicators
- `adapter/GeoplateformeGeocoder.java` — IGN Géoplateforme
- `adapter/InseeBdmIndexProvider.java` — INSEE BDM, SDMX-ML, 24 h cache
- `service/PropertyValuationService.java` — orchestration, persistence, balance write
- `service/PropertyAdjustments.java` — the heuristic coefficient table
- `service/RealEstateSummaryService.java` — gross / net / debt roll-up
- `controller/RealEstateController.java`, `controller/GeocodingController.java`
- `model/PropertyValuation.java`, `model/ValuationStatus.java`
- `resources/db/migration/V66__real_estate_valuation_and_ownership.sql`

**Frontend**
- `lib/property-icons.ts` — `PROPERTY_KIND_ICONS`, one lucide glyph per `PropertyKind`,
  shared by the add-property picker and the account card
- `components/property/PropertyDetailSection.tsx` — mounted from `AccountDetailPage` on
  `type === 'REAL_ESTATE'`
- `components/property/PropertyMetadataForm.tsx` — RHF + zod, five sections
- `components/property/AddressAutocomplete.tsx` — debounced, proxied through the backend
- `components/property/PropertyValuationCard.tsx` — estimate, band, method disclosure
- `components/property/PropertyValuationChart.tsx` — value over time vs cost basis
- `components/property/PropertyFinancingCard.tsx` — linked loans and equity
- `components/property/RealEstateSummaryCard.tsx` — dashboard roll-up

### What the account list sees

`RealEstateMetadataResponse` carries two fields the estimator does not use, both read by the
account card (see [accounts-overview.md](./accounts-overview.md#account-card-anatomy)):

- **`propertyKind`** — `property_type` run through `PropertyKind.parse`. The raw column stays
  on the response for the form, but anything branching on the kind reads the parsed value, so
  the alias table lives in Java only.
- **`lastValuedAt`** — the date of the newest `property_valuation` row, looked up in
  `AccountService.toResponse` alongside the metadata. It is read from the valuation table
  rather than tracked on the account so a property valued before the field existed reports
  its real date immediately, instead of waiting for the next monthly refresh. That is one
  extra query per property in the account list, on top of the metadata lookup already there.

### Data sources

| Source | Auth | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `apidf-preprod.cerema.fr` | none | still preprod, no documented rate limit, transient 503s |
| `data.geopf.fr/geocodage` | none | 50 req/s per IP |
| `api.insee.fr/series/BDM/V1` | none | quarterly index, one series per request |

## Technical choices

| Choice | Why | Rejected alternative |
|---|---|---|
| Persist the estimate, write the balance | Depends on two external HTTP services; recomputing per read would put a third party in every dashboard load | On-the-fly in `liveBalanceEur`, as loans do |
| Monthly refresh | DVF is published twice a year, the INSEE index is quarterly — a nightly run yields identical numbers | Daily, alongside the bank sync |
| Per-room-count series for apartments (`cod121x1..x5`) | The commune-wide flat median mixes studios with five-room apartments; the narrower bucket's median surfaces (25/45/66/85/112 m²) track room count closely | Always `cod121` |
| Garage/parking priced in m²-equivalent | A flat €12,000 is absurd in central Paris and equally absurd in a village | Fixed euro amount |
| Return a `status`, don't throw | "No data in Alsace-Moselle" is information the user needs, not a request failure | HTTP error codes for every non-estimate |
| The band goes through the same correction as the estimate | The adjustment is affine (`x → x·multiplier + area-equivalents`) with a positive multiplier, so putting the bounds through it preserves ordering: a band that contained the raw commune median still contains the corrected figure. Correcting only the headline value produced a band the estimate could sit outside of | Re-index the raw q25/q75 and relabel the band as the commune spread |
| No map dependency | Would be the first third-party UI library since the shadcn baseline, for a feature the BAN label already covers | Leaflet / MapLibre |

## Gotchas / Pitfalls

- **V66/V67 keep their numbers, below the current highest.** They were numbered above the
  crypto branch's then-V64/V65, which have since become V71/V72 (renumbered around main's own
  V64). They are deliberately *not* renumbered upward to match: they collide with nothing,
  `flyway.out-of-order` is enabled for exactly this, and V66 is already applied on running
  instances — renumbering would leave those with an applied migration Flyway cannot resolve,
  and the app would refuse to start. Verified: an instance at main's V70 takes V66/V67 out of
  order and validates cleanly.
- **Do not edit V66 or V67, not even a comment.** Flyway checksums the whole file, including
  comments, and both are already applied on running instances — an edit fails validation at
  startup on every one of them. V67 exists at all because of this rule. Corrections go here,
  not in the SQL.

- **The Cerema client needs a raised buffer.** One response carries every vintage back to
  2010 with ~200 indicator columns each — about 265 KB, just past WebClient's 256 KB default.
  Over the limit the body is never assembled and *every* commune fails. It shipped that way,
  and because the error was swallowed it surfaced as "no comparable transactions in this
  municipality", sending debugging towards the address instead of the logs. Transport
  failures now raise `ValuationProviderException` → `PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE`, which is a
  different message from an empty market.
- **Estimating a property with no metadata is a 400, not a 500.** `RealEstateMetadata` is only ever written by `updateRealEstateMetadata`, so a property created manually and valued before its address form is filled in is a routine precondition. `estimate()` threw `IllegalStateException`, for which `GlobalExceptionHandler` has no handler — the user got the generic 500 "An unexpected error occurred" and the log an ERROR with a full stack trace. It now throws `IllegalArgumentException` (400) naming what is missing, which `formatApiError` passes through to the user verbatim.
- **A property is never left at 0 €.** Without a valuation it falls back to its cost basis;
  0 € against a purchase price renders as a 100% loss, which reads as "your flat is
  worthless" rather than "no figure yet". The floor only ever lifts a zero — a real
  valuation, manual or estimated, is never overwritten.
- **`data.geopf.fr`, never `api-adresse.data.gouv.fr`.** The old host was decommissioned end of
  January 2026 and survives only as a cross-host 301. Any client not following redirects across
  hosts — or the day the redirect stops — breaks.
- **GeoJSON coordinates are `[longitude, latitude]`.** Reading them the other way round puts
  French addresses in the Indian Ocean, and nothing downstream would notice: the valuation
  would simply use the wrong commune's median.
- **Alsace-Moselle (57, 67, 68) and Mayotte (976) return `count: 0`, not an error.** They keep
  the *livre foncier* registry. Without the explicit department check that reads as "no recent
  sales" instead of "structurally no data".
- **INSEE multi-idBank requests 404.** The documented `id1+id2` form does not work on this
  endpoint; fetch one series at a time.
- **Cerema results come back oldest-first.** Walk the array backwards for the freshest vintage.
- **The vintage is a calendar year, treated as its midpoint** when re-indexing. Using January
  would systematically over-correct by half a year.
- **`property_type` is free text predating `PropertyKind`.** Old rows may hold anything,
  including French labels, so `PropertyKind.parse` is lenient and returns `null` rather than
  throwing.
- **DGFiP reuse conditions** forbid re-identification and search-engine indexing. Demo mode
  must therefore never ship real DVF records — a demo build is public by definition.
- **Each property in the monthly refresh commits on its own.** `refreshAllForMember` is
  deliberately *not* `@Transactional`; it drives a `TransactionTemplate` per property. The
  per-property try/catch alone does not isolate a database failure — JPA marks the transaction
  rollback-only when the provider raises, so a single surrounding transaction would throw
  `UnexpectedRollbackException` at commit and discard every property that had already
  succeeded. A test using a plain `IllegalStateException` cannot show this; the regression test
  throws a `DataAccessException` and counts the transaction boundaries.
- **The disclosed breakdown is capped alongside the total.** `additiveSqm` scales the
  garage/parking/land lines down proportionally when the 60 m²-equivalent ceiling bites. It
  used to record them at full size while capping only the total, so the "how this figure is
  built" panel added up to more than what went into the estimate — and that disclosure is what
  the ADR leans on to make a heuristic figure auditable.
- **The cost-basis floor is the one place the MANUAL lock does not hold.** `withCostBasisFloor`
  seeds the balance in `MANUAL` mode too, on the monthly job as well as a manual refresh. It is
  intentional — the lock protects a figure the user gave, and a zero is the absence of one —
  and it only ever lifts a zero. See `ValuationMode`'s javadoc.
- **`lastValuedAt` is a valuation date, not a sync date.** Nothing writes `lastSyncedAt` on a
  property account — a property described but never valued has neither, and its card renders
  without a freshness line, like any other manual account.
- **The account card grades it on a monthly scale, not the sync one.** `AccountCard` colours the
  freshness line by age, and a valuation is judged against `VALUATION_FRESHNESS_BOUNDS_MS`
  (green < 35 d, yellow < 60 d, orange < 90 d, red beyond) rather than the daily-cadence sync
  bounds. `monthlyPropertyValuation` runs on the 1st of each month, against sources that refresh
  twice a year at best, so a 40-day-old estimate is this feature working as designed — on the
  sync scale it would be permanently red, and a warning that is always on is one nobody reads.
  If the refresh cadence changes, move that scale with it. See
  [accounts-overview.md](./accounts-overview.md).
- **The q25/q75 band is not the raw commune spread.** `PropertyAdjustments.Result.applyTo`
  puts both bounds through the same multiplier and area-equivalent as the estimate, before
  re-indexing. It shipped re-indexing the bounds alone, which left a band that did not bracket
  the figure it was drawn around — a top-floor flat with a lift and two garages landed above
  its own q75. Anything added to the correction has to stay inside that transform, or the
  bracketing silently breaks again. Note it is data-dependent: a modest correction still lands
  inside the raw band, so it only shows up on well-equipped properties.
- **Adjustment coefficients are opinions, not a fitted model.** DVF records no floor, lift,
  garden or condition. They are bounded (multiplier clamped to [0.75, 1.25], area-equivalents
  capped) and every one is disclosed in the UI.

## Tests

- `CeremaDv3fValuationProviderTest` — vintage selection, room-count series, department
  fallback, uncovered areas, transient outages
- `ValuationAdapterWiringTest` — builds the adapters the way Spring does and serves a
  >256 KB payload over a real socket; stubbed `ClientResponse` fixtures decode with their own
  strategies, so neither the constructor nor the buffer regression is visible to them
- `GeoplateformeGeocoderTest` — INSEE mapping, coordinate order, overseas department codes
- `PropertyValuationServiceTest` — MANUAL lock, status paths, re-indexing, per-property guard,
  and a property without metadata reported as an `IllegalArgumentException` (400) rather than a
  server fault
- `PropertyAdjustmentsTest` — direction, bounds, no double-counting of energy vs era, and
  `applyTo` reproducing the headline transform, keeping the band around the estimate in both
  clamp directions, and passing a null bound through; the capped breakdown reconciling with the
  amount actually applied, and an uncapped one reported at full size
- `PropertyValuationServiceTest` — the persisted band brackets the estimate once the
  adjustments apply, and still does after re-indexing; a `DataAccessException` on one property
  rolls back only that property's transaction while the others commit
- `RealEstateSummaryServiceTest` — gross/net, multiple loans, divergent property/loan shares
- `RealEstateValuationMigrationTest` — Testcontainers; existing properties survive V66
- `PropertyValuationCard.test.tsx` — status rendering, manual mode, method disclosure
