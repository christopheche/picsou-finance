# Feature: Goals

> Last updated: 2026-09-06 (calendar panel keyed per month; "achieved" counts strictly-past months; goal form surfaces save failures)

## Context

Picsou lets users define savings goals with a target amount and deadline. Goals are linked to one or more accounts (M:N relationship). Progress is computed from the current balances of linked accounts compared to the target. Monthly tracking shows how much has been saved each month versus how much is needed, with optional per-month overrides.

## How it works

### Goal-Account relationship

A `Goal` has a M:N relationship with `Account` via the `goal_account` join table. An account can belong to multiple goals, and a goal can have multiple accounts. When progress is calculated, the balances of all linked accounts are summed.

### Progress calculation

`GoalService.toProgressResponse()` computes:

- **currentTotal**: Sum of `liveBalanceEur()` across all linked accounts. For holding accounts, this uses live prices from `PriceService` (with PnL). For cash accounts, falls back to stored balance converted to EUR.
- **percentComplete**: `(currentTotal / targetAmount) * 100`, rounded to 4 decimal places.
- **monthsLeft**: `ChronoUnit.MONTHS.between(today, deadline)`, minimum 0.
- **monthlyNeeded**: `(target - currentTotal) / monthsLeft`. If deadline has passed, the entire remaining amount is the monthly need.
- **avgMonthlyContribution**: Average monthly balance increase over the last 3 months, computed from `BalanceSnapshot` history and **summed across linked accounts** (each account's `(last − first) / elapsed months`, added up — two accounts growing 300/month give 600, the goal's real pace). It is compared against the goal-level `monthlyNeeded` (`surplus`, "at current pace" projection), so it must be the goal's pace, not the mean pace of one account. **Fallback for manually-tracked goals**: when no linked account has snapshot data (`accountsWithData == 0`), the average is computed from the recorded `GoalManualContribution` entries instead (sum ÷ count), so backfilled manual history refines the figure. Returns `null` only when neither source has data. Displayed in the UI but no longer drives `isOnTrack`.
- **isOnTrack**: `Σ effective(past months) >= Σ objective(past months)`. `effective` = `manualActual ?? snapshot-delta` (months with neither are skipped). `objective` = `override ?? monthlyNeeded`. "Past" = strictly before the current month (current month is in progress). Returns `true` when the goal has no `createdAt`, no past month, or no past month with data (benefit of the doubt).

### Monthly tracking

`GoalService.getMonthlyEntries()` generates a month-by-month breakdown from the *effective start month* to the deadline. The effective start is the goal's `createdAt` month, unless `Goal.historyStartMonth` is set to an earlier month (see **History backfill** below). For each month:

- **objective**: The auto-computed `monthlyNeeded`.
- **actual**: The real balance delta for that month (from snapshots: end-of-month balance minus end-of-previous-month balance). `null` for future months and for months with no snapshot recorded inside them (both lookups are "latest snapshot on or before", so a month without one would otherwise resolve to the same row twice and read as 0 saved — it is unknown, not zero).
- **manualActual**: A manually entered contribution amount (from `GoalManualContribution`). Takes precedence over computed actual.
- **override**: A per-month override for the objective (from `GoalMonthOverride`). Stored but tracked alongside the auto-computed value.
- **effective**: `manualActual` if set, otherwise `actual`. Never the override: the same rule applies in every entry writer (`setMonthOverride`, `setManualContribution`, `deleteManualContribution`, `deleteMonthOverride`).

The calendar page measures each month against `override ?? objective` (`frontend/src/features/goals/objective.ts`, `monthObjective`) — the same denominator `isOnTrack` uses — so an override moves the target of the donut/bar/"achieved" count while `effective` stays what was actually saved.

The "achieved x/y" badge counts **strictly past** months (`isStrictlyPast`), the same window
`isOnTrack` uses: the month in progress still appears in every view (as an ongoing month) but
never in the badge's denominator, where it would have read as a miss from the 1st of the month
and contradicted the "on track" badge on the goal card.

### Overrides and manual contributions

Two separate override mechanisms:

- **GoalMonthOverride**: Overrides the monthly savings *objective* for a specific month. Useful when the user plans to save more or less than the computed target.
- **GoalManualContribution**: Overrides the monthly savings *actual* for a specific month. Useful when the user wants to track contributions that don't appear in account balances (e.g. cash savings).

Both are keyed by the `{yearMonth}` path variable, stored as-is. `GoalService` validates it as strict `YYYY-MM` (`parseYearMonth`) before any lookup or write and rejects anything else with `IllegalArgumentException` → 400; previously a loose value ("2025-3", "foo") was saved first and only then blew up in `YearMonth.parse`, surfacing as a 500 (`GoalServiceTest.*_malformedMonth_*`).

### History backfill (before goal creation)

Users often start a goal in Picsou after they've already been saving for it. The backfill feature lets them extend the calendar *earlier* than the goal's creation date so they can record that prior history (typically as manual contributions).

- **`Goal.historyStartMonth`** (`VARCHAR(7)`, nullable, format `"YYYY-MM"`): when set and earlier than the `createdAt` month, the monthly calendar starts from this month. `null` keeps the default (`createdAt`-derived) start. Added in migration `V32__goal_history_start.sql`.
- **`GoalService.effectiveStartMonth(goal)`**: returns `min(createdAt month, historyStartMonth)` — the single source of truth for where the calendar begins.
- **`POST /api/goals/{id}/history/extend`** → `GoalService.extendHistory()`: decrements the effective start by one year and persists it as the new `historyStartMonth`. The frontend exposes this via a slim "+ Add {year}" card above the calendar (`useExtendGoalHistory`), where `year = earliestRenderedYear - 1`.
- **`POST /api/goals/{id}/history/extend/month`** → `GoalService.extendHistoryByMonth()`: same mechanism but decrements the effective start by a single month — for fine-grained backfill (e.g. only the earlier months of the current year, before goal creation). The frontend exposes this via a "+ previous month" card prepended to the earliest year's month row in the grid (`useExtendGoalHistoryByMonth`). Both endpoints coexist: yearly jumps and month-by-month refinement.
- Backfilled months have no snapshot data, so they render empty until the user fills them in manually.
- **`isOnTrack` is deliberately NOT affected by backfill**: it stays anchored to `createdAt` (`isOnTrackFromPastMonths` is unchanged). Backfill is history-only — when actuals come from linked accounts, extending the window backwards must not retroactively change the "on track" verdict. Backfilled manual contributions *do* feed `avgMonthlyContribution` (see above), refining the "average monthly" figure for manually-tracked goals.

### Flow

```
Create goal (name, targetAmount, deadline, accountIds)
        |
        v
GoalService.create() --> save Goal with linked accounts
        |
        v
GoalService.toProgressResponse()
        |
        +-- sum liveBalanceEur() per account --> currentTotal
        +-- compute monthsLeft, monthlyNeeded
        +-- calculateAvgMonthlyContribution() from snapshots
        +-- determine isOnTrack
        |
        v
Get monthly entries:
        |
        v
GoalService.getMonthlyEntries(goalId)
        |
        +-- for each month from creation to deadline:
        |       +-- calculateActualForMonth() from snapshots
        |       +-- lookup GoalManualContribution
        |       +-- lookup GoalMonthOverride
        |       +-- build GoalMonthEntryResponse
        |
        v
Set month override:
GoalService.setMonthOverride(goalId, yearMonth, amount)
        --> upsert GoalMonthOverride
        --> return updated entry
```

## Technical choices

| Choice | Why | Rejected alternative |
|--------|-----|----------------------|
| M:N goal-account relationship | A savings goal often spans multiple accounts (checking + savings + PEA) | One account per goal (too restrictive) |
| Snapshot-based actual calculation | Uses existing BalanceSnapshot data; no need for a separate transaction import | Dedicated savings transaction table |
| Separate override + manual contribution | Different semantics: override changes the target, manual contribution changes the actual | Single override field (loses information) |
| 3-month average for `avgMonthlyContribution` | Short enough to reflect recent behavior, long enough to smooth out noise | 6-month or 12-month average (too slow to reflect changes) |
| `isOnTrack` from cumulative past months | Single source of truth with the `/goals/:id/calendar` view; lets the user influence the badge indirectly via overrides + manual contributions | Snapshot-based 3-month average (decoupled from what the calendar shows; could not be influenced by user adjustments) |
| `null` for no history | Distinguishes "no data yet" from "zero contribution"; `isOnTrack` treats null as "benefit of the doubt" | Return zero (would mark new goals as "not on track") |
| `liveBalanceEur()` for currentTotal | Holding accounts show real portfolio value with PnL, not stale sync-time balance | `AccountResponse.currentBalanceEur` (does not reflect live prices) |
| `<Badge variant="secondary">` for account chips | Uses theme semantic tokens (luma preset); consistent with rest of the UI | Per-account pastel `<span>` with `style={{ background: a.color }}` |
| `<Badge variant="default">` for achieved/on track status | Solid primary color; visible and unambiguous | Pastel `bg-green-500/10` (barely visible, not theme-aware) |

## Gotchas / Pitfalls

- **Accounts can belong to multiple goals**: If an account is linked to two goals, its full balance counts toward both goals' `currentTotal`. There is no "partial allocation."
- **Monthly actual is computed from snapshots, not transactions**: The actual savings for a month is the delta between end-of-month snapshot balances. If snapshots are missing (e.g. new account, no sync, instance offline for the month), that month will have `null` actual and is skipped by `isOnTrack` rather than counted as 0 against a full objective.
- **"Today" comes from the injected `java.time.Clock`** (`GoalService.today()`, JVM default zone): `monthsLeft`, the 3-month contribution window and the past/current month boundary all derive from it. `GoalServiceTest` pins the clock to a mid-month date so `plusMonths` never clamps — on a month-end day `deadline = today + 3 months` is only 2 whole months away and `monthlyNeeded` jumps.
- **Override does not recalculate monthlyNeeded**: Setting a month override changes that month's *objective* (the denominator in the calendar and in `isOnTrack`), not the displayed savings and not the computed `monthlyNeeded`. The auto-computed objective (`objective` in the entry) is always based on `(target - current) / monthsLeft`.
- **Effective-start to deadline range**: `getMonthlyEntries()` iterates from the effective start month (`min(createdAt, historyStartMonth)`) to the deadline month. If the goal was created mid-month, the first month's actual may be partial. Backfilled months (before `createdAt`) never have snapshot data.
- **`findAllWithAccounts()` uses a custom query**: Goals are fetched with their accounts eagerly loaded to avoid N+1 queries during progress calculation.
- **The month detail panel is keyed by `yearMonth`.** Its two inputs are seeded by lazy `useState` initializers (the [key-remount pattern](../conventions/frontend.md)), which only run at mount. Without `key={selectedEntry.yearMonth}` the desktop side panel is one long-lived instance, so selecting another month kept the previously typed amounts on screen and "Save override" / "Save manual" wrote them against the newly selected month.
- **Account membership is member-scoped (IDOR guard)**: `create`/`update` resolve `accountIds` via `accountRepository.findByIdInAndMemberId(...)`, never the inherited `findAllById`. A caller can only attach accounts they own; a foreign/nonexistent id fails the size check with a generic 400. Do **not** revert this to `findAllById` — that re-opens a cross-member balance-disclosure IDOR (security audit 2026-06-27, CWE-639).

## Tests

- `GoalServiceTest` -- unit tests for progress calculation, monthly entries, override/manual-contribution writers (member scoping, upsert, override-vs-effective semantics), multi-account pace, months without snapshots, edge cases (deadline passed, no history). Runs on a fixed `Clock`.
- `frontend/src/features/goals/objective.test.ts` -- `monthObjective` (override as denominator)
- `frontend/src/pages/goals/GoalCalendarPage.test.tsx` -- selecting another month reloads the panel inputs from that month (the key-remount above), and the "achieved" badge counts only strictly-past months
- `frontend/src/pages/goals/GoalsPage.test.tsx` -- a rejected create keeps the dialog open and shows the backend reason; a successful one closes it

## Frontend notes

- **Account chips** use `<Badge variant="secondary">` — theme-aware, no per-account color. The `ACCOUNT_COLORS` palette is still used elsewhere (ColorPicker, DistributionPie, AccountCard, FinaryTab) but not in goal cards.
- **Status badges**: achieved/on track use `variant="default"` (primary), behind uses `variant="destructive"`, waiting uses `variant="secondary"`.
- **Calendar badges**: the "manual" badge uses `variant="secondary"`, the "modified" one `variant="outline"` — no raw Tailwind color overrides. Their labels, and the objective caption in the year grid and calendar grid, are translated (`goals.manualShort`, `goals.modifiedShort`, `goals.objectiveShort`); they used to be the hardcoded French `manu.` / `modif.` / `obj.`. The `€` adornment on the panel inputs stays literal: every goal figure is in EUR (`CurrencyDisplay` defaults to it), and a currency symbol is not a translatable string.
- **Save failures are shown, never swallowed**: the goal dialog wraps `mutateAsync` in a `try/catch` and renders `formatApiError(err, t)` in a `role="alert"` line above the footer, keeping the dialog open. The calendar's not-found state goes through `formatApiError` too and retries with the query's `refetch` — never `error.message` (raw axios text) and never the non-existent `common.notFound` key.
- **Icons**: `TrendingUp`/`TrendingDown` come from `lucide-react` (not HugeIcons) in the goals pages.
- **Goal detail chart**: `GoalDetailModal` reuses the shared `NetWorthChart` with the optional `target`, `projection`, and `todayMs` props. The chart draws:
  - A dashed `var(--chart-3)` ideal trajectory from `(goal.createdAt, balanceAtCreation)` to `(goal.deadline, goal.targetAmount)`, where `balanceAtCreation` is the first history point at or after `goal.createdAt`. Using the baseline (not zero) keeps the trajectory in the same reference frame as the live area, so the visual matches the "behind/on track" badge.
  - A dotted `var(--muted-foreground)` "at current pace" projection from `(today, currentTotal)` to `(goal.deadline, currentTotal + avgMonthlyContribution * monthsLeft)`, rendered as an `Area` with a faint left→right gradient so the chart fades into the future rather than cutting net at today. Skipped when `avgMonthlyContribution` is null (no history yet).
  - A vertical "today" reference line marking the boundary between past data and future projection. Only drawn when a target/projection extends past the data.
  - When `target` is set, history is cropped on the left to `target.startDate`. On the `ALL` range, the X axis is stretched right up to the deadline so the projection beyond today is visible.
  - The goal modal passes `showInvested={false}` to declutter the legend (capital-invested is irrelevant for a savings goal).
  - The `target`/`projection`/`todayMs` props are opt-in: Dashboard / Accounts / AccountDetail don't pass them and remain unchanged.
