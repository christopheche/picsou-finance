# Feature: Admin Page (instance settings)

> Last updated: 2026-05-29 (create-user-from-Admin + login derived from display name)

## Context

After the [first-launch Setup Wizard](./setup-wizard.md) finishes, the user has no way
to change CORS origins, the `Secure` cookie flag, Enable Banking credentials, or
toggle integrations on/off without editing rows in `app_setting` by hand. The Admin
page exposes those same `SetupService` writers behind a role-gated `/admin` route so
a self-host admin can reconfigure the instance from the browser.

The page also surfaces a **Members** section that lets the admin **create a user**
(name field + "Create user" button — provisions a managed profile *and* its login
in one step, then shows the activation link to share), see every family member with
their display name and login (username), invite a managed profile via a one-shot
activation link, reset an active user's password by sending the same
`/activate/{token}` link with a fresh token, and delete a non-activated managed
profile. The actions reuse `FamilyService` writers behind the existing
`/api/family/**` admin gate (`requireAdmin()`).

The login **username is derived from the display name** ("Jean Dupont" →
`jean.dupont`), replacing the legacy `member_<id>` scheme. `FamilyService`
slugifies the name (NFD accent strip, lowercase, non-alphanumeric runs → a single
dot, trimmed) and appends a numeric suffix (`.2`, `.3`, …) until unique. The
"Create user" flow is the two existing endpoints chained client-side
(`POST /api/family/members` then `POST /api/family/members/{id}/activate`) via the
`useCreateUserWithLogin` hook — no new endpoint.

## How it works

A single `AdminController` (`/api/admin/**`) wraps existing `SetupService` writers
(`writeSecurity`, `writeEnableBankingConfig`) and `IntegrationsService.enable / disable`.
URL-level guard: `.requestMatchers("/api/admin/**").hasRole("ADMIN")` in
`SecurityConfig`. The frontend mirrors the gate with a `RequireAdmin` route guard
that redirects non-admins to `/error/403`.

The `GET /settings` endpoint returns one `AdminSettingsResponse` containing the three
sub-sections so the page renders from a single query — no fan-out, single
`adminKeys.settings()` cache key invalidated by every mutation.

### Key files

Backend:
- `backend/src/main/java/com/picsou/controller/AdminController.java` — endpoints:
  `GET /settings`, `PUT /settings/security`, `PUT /settings/enablebanking`,
  `PATCH /settings/integrations/{key}?enabled=...`, plus EB keypair management
  `POST /settings/enablebanking/keypair` (idempotent generate) and
  `/keypair/import` (422 on a bad PEM — `EnableBankingKeyPairService` throws
  `InvalidKeyMaterialException`, mapped by `GlobalExceptionHandler`; the controller has
  no try/catch). `GET /settings` reads EB credentials from
  the *resolved* `EnableBankingConfigProvider` (DB-then-env), not raw DB rows, so
  env-configured installs report their real values rather than blanks.
- `backend/src/main/java/com/picsou/dto/AdminSettingsResponse.java` — record with
  nested `SecuritySettings` and `EnableBankingSettings` (the latter carries a
  `privateKeyPresent` boolean so the UI can flag a missing key-file).
- `backend/src/main/java/com/picsou/dto/AdminSecurityRequest.java` — `@NotNull
  @Size(min=1) List<String> allowedOrigins`, `boolean secureCookies`.
- `backend/src/main/java/com/picsou/dto/AdminEnableBankingRequest.java` — three
  `@NotBlank` fields.
- `backend/src/main/java/com/picsou/config/SecurityConfig.java:57` — the
  `hasRole("ADMIN")` matcher.
- `backend/src/main/java/com/picsou/service/SetupService.java` — re-used writers
  (`writeSecurity` line 151, `writeEnableBankingConfig` line 168, `readSetting`
  line 186, `INTEGRATIONS` constant line 37).

Frontend:
- `frontend/src/pages/admin/AdminPage.tsx` — page shell, single
  `useAdminSettings()` query, sections aligned with the main app column rather
  than centered in a narrow wrapper.
- `frontend/src/pages/admin/sections/SecuritySection.tsx` — RHF +
  `useFieldArray` for CORS origins, `Controller` + `Switch` for the secure-cookie
  flag, Zod schema requires at least one origin. The form adopts refetched server
  values **only while it is pristine** (see the gotcha below) and re-baselines on
  the accepted values after a successful save.
- `frontend/src/pages/admin/sections/EnableBankingSection.tsx` — RHF over a
  `FIELDS` array, Zod with `.url()` on `redirectUri`. Same pristine-only seeding
  as the security form.
- `frontend/src/pages/admin/sections/IntegrationsSection.tsx` — six hardcoded keys
  (`enablebanking, boursobank, boursedirect, traderepublic, finary, crypto`)
  toggled via `useToggleIntegration`. Bourse Direct has no dedicated health probe:
  its switch reflects the stored `integration.boursedirect` setting only, like
  every other key in this list.
- `frontend/src/pages/admin/sections/MembersSection.tsx` — create-user form (name
  + "Create user" button) on top, then the list of family members with avatar,
  display name, login, derived status; per-member actions: create / regenerate
  activation link, reset password, reset 2FA, delete. Generated/activation link is
  shown inline with a copy button; no email is sent (self-hosted, admin transmits
  manually). Every one of those mutations renders its failure through
  `formatApiError` in a `role="alert"` block (creation under the create row, the
  link/reset failures above the link box, the 2FA reset inside its `ConfirmDialog`)
  — a failed step used to be completely silent.
- `frontend/src/features/family/hooks.ts` — `useCreateUserWithLogin` chains
  `createMember` + `generateActivationLink` (one loading/error state, returns the
  activation link); plus `useFamilyMembers`, `useDeleteMember`,
  `useGenerateActivationLink`, `useResetMemberPassword`.
- `backend/src/main/java/com/picsou/service/FamilyService.java` — `deriveUsername`
  slugifier (used by `generateActivationToken`) + member CRUD / token writers.
- `frontend/src/features/admin/api.ts` — `adminApi` (typed endpoints).
- `frontend/src/features/admin/hooks.ts` — `useAdminSettings`,
  `useUpdateSecurity`, `useUpdateEnableBanking`, `useToggleIntegration` (all
  invalidate `adminKeys.settings()`).
- `frontend/src/features/auth/guards.tsx` — appended `RequireAdmin`
  (`user.role !== 'ADMIN'` → `/error/403`).
- `frontend/src/app/routes.tsx` — lazy route
  `{ path: 'admin', element: <SuspensePage><RequireAdmin><AdminPage /></RequireAdmin></SuspensePage> }`.
- `frontend/src/components/layout/AppSidebar.tsx` — admin-only `DropdownMenuItem`
  with the `Shield` icon, before Logout.
- `frontend/src/pages/settings/SettingsPage.tsx` — admin-only "Admin" section
  card after Family.
- `frontend/src/i18n/locales/{fr,en}.json` — `admin.*` namespace + `nav.admin`,
  `nav.admin.desc`, `settings.adminSection*`.

### Flow

```
User clicks "Admin" (sidebar dropdown OR Settings page card)
    │
    ▼
RequireAdmin guard (user.role === 'ADMIN' ?)  ── no ──► /error/403
    │ yes
    ▼
AdminPage mounts → useAdminSettings() → GET /api/admin/settings
    │
    ▼
Render { SecuritySection, EnableBankingSection, IntegrationsSection }
    │
    ▼
On submit / toggle ──► PUT or PATCH ──► invalidate adminKeys.settings()
                                          ──► sections re-render with fresh data
```

## Technical choices

| Choice | Why | Rejected alternative |
|--------|-----|----------------------|
| URL-based `hasRole("ADMIN")` in `SecurityConfig` | One line, no annotations on every endpoint, hard to forget. | `@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")` on each method (easy to omit on a new endpoint). |
| Re-use `SetupService` writers | Same persistence path as the wizard → one source of truth for `app_setting` semantics (CSV joining for origins, key naming). | Dedicated `AdminService` duplicating the upsert logic (drift risk). |
| Single `GET /settings` aggregating all three sections | Page renders from one query, one cache key, trivial invalidation. | Three separate endpoints (`/security`, `/enablebanking`, `/integrations`) — more calls, three cache keys to invalidate. |
| `PATCH /settings/integrations/{key}?enabled=bool` | Each toggle is independent; matches the per-integration mental model. | A single `PUT` accepting the full integrations map (a stale UI state could clobber another concurrent change). |
| Frontend `RequireAdmin` mirrors the backend gate | Admin link must not show for non-admins, even if they could be tricked into navigating. | Pure backend gate with a 403 page — UI shows a dead link. |
| `useFieldArray` for CORS origins | The wizard's Security step also takes a list; UX consistency, plus easy add/remove without manual array splice. | Comma-separated text input (parses ambiguously, no per-row validation feedback). |

## Gotchas / Pitfalls

- **`hasRole("ADMIN")` requires the `ROLE_` prefix in the security context.**
  `JwtAuthenticationFilter` builds authorities as `"ROLE_" + user.getRole().name()`,
  so `hasRole("ADMIN")` (which strips the prefix) lines up. If anyone refactors the
  filter to store bare role names, the admin guard silently becomes a no-match and
  every admin user starts getting 403s.
- **CORS origins are stored as a single CSV string** in `app_setting`
  (`cors.allowed-origins`). `getSettings` does `Arrays.asList(s.split(","))` — if the
  value is empty the result is a single empty string, not an empty list. The frontend
  Zod schema (`.min(1)` on each entry) catches the empty-string row, but if you
  bypass the form and POST a single `[""]` you'll write back the literal empty value.
  `SetupService.writeSecurity` is the only safe writer; do not duplicate the CSV
  formatting elsewhere.
- **The integration toggle shows the *effective* state, not the raw flag.**
  `getSettings` reports `integrationsService.isEffectivelyEnabled(key)`, which ORs
  the stored `app_setting` flag with a cheap per-integration config probe: Enable
  Banking → `EnableBankingConfigProvider.isConfiguredLenient()` (creds + key
  present, no parsing); Trade Republic / Finary → a login-session row exists;
  BoursoBank (network-only) / crypto (nothing to detect) → fall back to the flag.
  This is why an install configured purely via `.env` / docker-compose — which
  never ran the wizard, so the flag stayed `false` — still shows its integrations
  *on*. Consequence: an env-configured integration **cannot be turned off** from
  the toggle (the connector reads env directly and ignores the flag, so a `PATCH`
  to `false` snaps back to `on` on the next `GET`). The switch reflects reality
  rather than a stale boolean — to disable, remove the env config / delete the
  session.
- **Toggling an integration off does not delete its credentials** (TR session,
  Bourso session, EB requisitions, encrypted exchange API keys). It only flips the
  `app_setting` flag. Re-enabling restores prior connectivity. By design — flipping
  a sync provider off temporarily must not nuke the user's stored secrets.
- **Changes to `cors.allowed-origins` and `app.secure-cookies` take effect without
  restart** because `DynamicCorsConfigurationSource` reads them from `app_setting`
  on each request and the cookie helper reads `secure-cookies` per response. If
  someone reverts to `@Value`-based static config, the admin page will appear to
  succeed but nothing will actually change until the container restarts.
- **`PATCH` must remain in CORS allowed methods.** The integrations toggle uses
  `PATCH`; if `SecurityConfig.corsConfigurationSource` ever loses `PATCH` from its
  methods list, every toggle will preflight-fail in the browser with no server-side
  log entry.
- **Settings page card and sidebar dropdown both gate on `user?.role === 'ADMIN'`
  client-side.** This is a usability-only check; the real authorization is the
  backend matcher. Don't be tempted to remove the duplicate gate "to DRY it" — they
  guard different things (link visibility vs. endpoint access).
- **The username is derived only when the login is first created**
  (`generateActivationToken`, `existingUser == null` branch), not at managed-profile
  creation — the `AppUser` doesn't exist until then. Renaming a member afterwards
  (`updateDisplayName`) does **not** change an already-issued login username; that's
  intentional (a login identifier is stable). The slug uses only `[a-z0-9.]`, a
  subset of the `[A-Za-z0-9._-]` setup pattern, so it's always a legal username.
- **"Create user" is two chained requests, not atomic.** If the second call
  (`/activate`) fails after the profile is created, you get a managed profile with no
  login — recoverable from the same screen via the per-member "Create login" button.
  No new backend endpoint was added precisely to reuse this idempotent recovery path.
  The chained failure is surfaced under the create row and the typed name is kept,
  so the admin recovers instead of re-submitting and creating a duplicate profile.
- **Admin forms seed from the server only while pristine.** Every admin mutation
  invalidates `adminKeys.settings()`, so the sections receive a fresh `settings`
  prop at unpredictable times. Resetting react-hook-form from it unconditionally
  wiped CORS origins or EB credentials the admin had typed but not yet saved
  (generating a key pair flips `privateKeyPresent` and is enough to trigger it).
  The effect now returns early when `formState.isDirty`; `onSubmit` calls
  `reset(values)` so a saved form goes pristine again and resumes tracking.

## Tests

- `backend/src/test/java/com/picsou/controller/AdminControllerTest.java` —
  Mockito tests covering the four endpoints: `getSettings` aggregation,
  `updateSecurity` and `updateEnableBanking` delegation to `SetupService`,
  `toggleIntegration` with `enabled=true/false`. URL-level role gate is enforced by
  Spring Security and not exercised by these unit tests; coverage relies on the
  `SecurityConfig` matcher being correct.
- `backend/src/test/java/com/picsou/service/FamilyServiceTest.java` — Mockito tests
  for the username derivation in `generateActivationToken`: simple slug, accent +
  space normalization (`Jean Dupont` → `jean.dupont`, `Élodie` → `elodie`),
  collision suffix (`alice` → `alice.2`), and the blank/non-alphanumeric fallback
  (`!!!` → `user`).
- No dedicated integration test for the role gate (manual verification — same
  approach as `security-cors-cookies.md`). A future MockMvc slice test asserting a
  USER-role request is rejected with 403 would close the gap.
- Frontend coverage is `bun run typecheck` + `bun run build` + manual flow only;
  no Vitest component tests for the admin sections yet.
