# Feature: Finary Import

> Last updated: 2026-09-06

## Context

Finary is a French personal finance app. Picsou supports importing data from Finary via two methods: uploading an xlsx export file, or direct API sync using Finary credentials. Both methods use a two-phase flow (preview then execute) to let users review and map accounts before committing. Once accounts are mapped, a one-click auto-sync skips the mapping UI and syncs in the background, running daily via the scheduler.

## How it works

### Two import paths

**1. XLSX file import** (`FinaryImportService`)

The user exports their Finary data as an xlsx file and uploads it via the API. The file contains sheets per asset category (Checkings, Savings, Investments, Real Estate, Cryptos, Fonds Euro, Commodities, Credits, Other Assets, Startups) plus a Transactions sheet.

- **Preview**: `preview(MultipartFile)` parses the xlsx with Apache POI, extracts accounts and transactions, generates a UUID `fileToken`, stores parsed data in a `ConcurrentHashMap` cache, and returns account previews with suggested types and existing Picsou accounts for mapping.
- **Execute**: `executeImport(FinaryImportRequest)` retrieves cached data by `fileToken`, applies user mappings (SKIP / MAP_EXISTING / CREATE_NEW), creates accounts, reconstructs balance snapshots from transactions, and imports transactions.

**2. Direct API sync** (`FinaryApiSyncService`)

Authenticates directly with Finary via Clerk (their auth provider) and fetches accounts + transactions through the Finary API.

- **Authentication**: `FinaryApiClient.authenticate()` performs a 6-step Clerk OAuth flow: GET environment, GET client, POST sign_ins, (optionally POST TOTP), POST session touch, POST tokens. Returns a JWT for API calls.
- **TOTP/2FA handling**: When Clerk returns `needs_second_factor`, the backend throws `TotpRequiredException` → HTTP 403. The frontend detects 403 on the preview mutation, shows a TOTP input field, then retries with `{"totp": "{code}"}` in the JSON body of the same POST.
- **Preview**: `preview(totp)` authenticates, fetches accounts from all 10 portfolio categories **plus the dedicated `/loans` endpoint** (loans are not exposed as a portfolio category), fetches transactions (paginated, 200 per page), caches everything with a `syncToken`, returns previews.
- **Execute**: `execute(syncToken, mappings)` retrieves cached data, applies user mappings, creates/updates accounts, imports transactions.

### Account mapping

Both paths present the user with a mapping screen where they choose for each Finary account:

- **SKIP** -- Ignore this account entirely.
- **MAP_EXISTING** -- Link the Finary account to an existing Picsou account: its balance and currency take the Finary figure, `lastSyncedAt` is stamped and `externalAccountId` is bound to the Finary id (both paths; the xlsx path used to leave the account untouched, so today's snapshot and `currentBalance` disagreed). Only **mappable** accounts qualify -- `FinaryPersistenceHelper.isMappable`: manual accounts that are unbound or already bound to Finary (`finary_` prefix). The preview offers only those, and `execute`/`executeImport` reject any other target with a 400: mapping onto a provider-synced account (Trade Republic, IBKR, Enable Banking...) would rebind its external id (the connector then recreates a duplicate on its next sync), delete its non-manual transactions and wipe its whole snapshot history.
- **CREATE_NEW** -- Create a new Picsou account with user-specified name, type, provider, and color.

Type suggestions are auto-computed from the Finary category via `FinaryPersistenceHelper.suggestTypeFromDisplayCategory()` or `suggestTypeFromApiCategory()`.

### Cache and session management

- `FinaryImportService` uses a `ConcurrentHashMap` with 30-minute expiry (cleaned every 60s by `@Scheduled`).
- `FinaryApiSyncService` uses a `ConcurrentHashMap` with 10-minute expiry (cleaned every 60s by `@Scheduled`).
- Cache tokens are UUIDs. The preview+execute must complete within the TTL or the user must re-upload.
- The xlsx `ParsedFinaryData` carries the previewing `memberId`; `executeImport` rejects a token presented by another member (400), mirroring the account binding of the CSV transaction importer.

### Auto-sync

`FinaryApiSyncService.autoSync(memberId)` is the fast path when all Finary accounts are already known to Picsou (i.e., every account returned by the preview has a matching `externalAccountId` in the DB):

1. Runs the preview phase (authenticate + fetch).
2. Checks `autoMapped` flag: if all accounts have an `externalAccountId` match, auto-generates the `MAP_EXISTING` mappings and calls `execute()` directly.
3. If any new account is found: returns `{ status: "NEEDS_MAPPING" }` — the user must go through the mapping UI.
4. If Finary requires TOTP: sets `FinarySession.status = "TOTP_REQUIRED"` and returns gracefully.

**REST endpoint:** `POST /api/finary/api-sync/auto` → `FinaryAutoSyncResponse { status, accountsSynced, newAccountCount }`

Possible status values: `OK`, `NEEDS_MAPPING`, `TOTP_REQUIRED`, `NOT_CONNECTED`.

**Scheduler:** `SchedulerService.dailyBankSync()` calls `autoSync()` for each family member at 08:00 UTC. If it returns `NEEDS_MAPPING`, a warning is logged and the user must sync manually. If `TOTP_REQUIRED`, the session is flagged and the user must re-authenticate.

**Frontend:** The "Sync Finary" button in `FinaryTab` calls `POST /api/finary/api-sync/auto`. On `OK` it shows a success toast. On `NEEDS_MAPPING` it falls through to the full preview+mapping wizard. On `TOTP_REQUIRED` it shows the TOTP input and the user retries via the preview endpoint.

```

## Technical choices

| Choice | Why | Rejected alternative |
|--------|-----|----------------------|
| Two-phase preview+execute | Lets users review accounts and fix mappings before committing data | Direct import (no review, risk of duplicates/wrong types) |
| ConcurrentHashMap cache | Simple, no Redis dependency, single-user app | Redis or DB-backed cache (overkill) |
| Apache POI for xlsx | Standard Java library for Excel; Finary exports in xlsx format | CSV parsing (Finary does not export CSV) |
| Clerk auth flow reimplemented | Finary uses Clerk for auth; no official API; must reverse-engineer the 6-step flow | Finary API key (does not exist) |
| `TotpRequiredException` → 403 | Frontend already checks for 403 on preview mutations; 401 would trigger the Picsou JWT refresh flow which is wrong | Using 401 (conflicts with Picsou auth refresh), using 502 (frontend can't distinguish from real errors) |
| `FinaryServiceUnavailableException` → 502 | Distinguishes upstream outage (Clerk/Finary unreachable) from data sync issues; frontend shows "service unavailable" message | Returning 502 for all sync errors (confusing, cannot distinguish cause) |
| `SyncException` → 422 | Data/sync issues (bad response, mapping failures) are client errors, not gateway errors | 502 BAD_GATEWAY (semantically wrong for data processing failures) |
| Retry with exponential backoff | Transient HTTP 5xx and network errors from Clerk/Finary are common; retry reduces false failures | No retry (fails on first attempt even for transient issues) |
| Auto-mapping by name | Simple heuristic that works for most cases after first manual import | ML-based matching (unnecessary complexity) |

## Gotchas / Pitfalls

- **TOTP must be disabled for background auto-sync**: `autoSync()` passes `null` for TOTP. If 2FA is enabled on the Finary account, auto-sync returns `TOTP_REQUIRED` and the session is flagged. The user must re-authenticate interactively (via the preview endpoint with TOTP). For interactive sync via the frontend button, the TOTP input is shown and the user retries through the preview flow.
- **Manual transactions survive Finary re-syncs**: `FinaryPersistenceHelper.importTransactions()` calls `deleteByAccountIdAndIsManualFalse()` instead of `deleteByAccountId()`. Manually-added transactions are preserved across any number of re-syncs.
- **TOTP travels in the request body, not the query string**: the preview endpoint reads `totp` from the JSON body (`FinaryApiSyncPreviewRequest`), validated as six digits and optional -- the first attempt sends `{}`. It used to be `?totp={code}`, which put a live second factor into nginx/Caddy access logs, browser history and any log-shipping pipeline. Every other connector (DEGIRO, Bourse Direct, Amundi) and the app's own MFA already sent codes in the body.
- **Every Clerk sign-in is throttled**: `/check-totp`, `/api-sync/preview` and `/api-sync/auto` each run the full 6-step Clerk login with the stored credentials, so they share one per-IP bucket (`finaryAuthBuckets`, 5 attempts / 15 min) and answer 429 with a ProblemDetail past it. Without it the 6-digit second factor is brute-forceable through `preview`, and Clerk sees an unbounded stream of sign-ins from the instance's single IP -- which is what gets that IP blocked for the whole family. `/api-sync/execute` works off the cached preview and authenticates nothing, so it is not on the bucket. The xlsx `/preview` upload shares the sync buckets instead, like every other multipart endpoint.
- **Preview tokens expire quickly**: XLSX tokens expire after 30 minutes, API sync tokens after 10 minutes. Users must complete the mapping within that window or re-upload.
- **Clerk API version is hardcoded**: The `__clerk_api_version` and `_clerk_js_version` query parameters are hardcoded in `FinaryApiClient`. If Clerk updates, these may need to be updated.
- **Account name matching is case-insensitive but exact**: Auto-mapping matches Finary account name to Picsou account name. If the user renamed an account in Picsou, it won't match.
- **Transactions are per-category**: API sync fetches transactions only from checkings, savings, investments, and credits categories. Other categories (real estate, cryptos) do not have a transactions endpoint.
- **External IDs use Finary category + ID**: Format is `finary_{category}_{finaryId}`. This means the same Finary account always maps to the same external ID, preventing duplicates across imports.
- **Loans come from a separate endpoint (issue #11)**: loan/mortgage accounts are *not* returned by the portfolio `credits`/`credit_accounts` categories — they live on the dedicated `/loans` endpoint. The API sync fetches them via `FinaryApiClient.fetchLoans()` and adapts each entry to the common `FinaryAccountDto` under a synthetic `loans` category (external ID `finary_loans_{id}`), so they flow through the normal preview/mapping/execute pipeline and map to `AccountType.LOAN`. The outstanding amount is stored as a **positive** balance -- a loan is a liability, and the LOAN aggregation negates it (`DashboardService` adds LOAN accounts to `totalLiabilities`, `AccountService.signedLiveBalanceEur` flips the sign; see [loans.md](loans.md) and [dashboard-liabilities-separation.md](dashboard-liabilities-separation.md)). Storing it negative would double-negate the liability and *add* the loan to net worth. Only the balance is imported — the loans payload does not expose the original principal or interest rate, so **no `Debt` row is created**; the imported LOAN account shows a static balance until the user fills in the loan parameters for the amortization view (see [loans.md](loans.md)). The exact `/loans` JSON shape and path are best-effort from the issue's sample (`type`, `name`, `outstanding_amount`, `monthly_repayment`, `start_date`, `end_date`); `FinaryLoanDto` maps the snake_case keys explicitly and accepts camelCase aliases as a fallback.
- **Import mapping wizard type dropdown includes all account types (fix #17)**: The `CREATE_NEW` type selector in `FinaryTab` now uses `ACCOUNT_TYPES` from `@/lib/constants` instead of a hard-coded subset. This ensures `LOAN` and `REAL_ESTATE` are available in the dropdown, so loans imported from `/loans` are no longer forced into `OTHER` when the user overrides the backend suggestion.
- **Error status codes are differentiated (fix #27)**: `FinaryServiceUnavailableException` returns 502 (Clerk/Finary unreachable), `SyncException` returns 422 (data/sync issue), `TotpRequiredException` returns 403. Previously all sync errors returned 502. The frontend uses a `getFinaryError()` helper to show localized messages per status code.
- **Reconstructed snapshots are end-of-day figures**: `reconstructSnapshots` / `reconstructSnapshotsFromDb` walk the transactions backwards from the current balance and record, under each transaction date D, the balance *after* D's own flows -- the same meaning as the scheduler's daily row, which `HistoryService` forward-fills from the latest snapshot on or before each date. The pre-history balance (before the earliest transaction) is written under the day before it, so the first deposit reads as a step rather than a ramp. Storing the pre-flow balance under D (the old behaviour) made every deposit land one snapshot late on the chart.
- **Upstream errors are not echoed to the user**: `FinaryApiClient` and `FinaryApiSyncService` wrap Clerk/Finary failures in `SyncException` with a fixed friendly message ("Could not fetch your Finary accounts (crypto). Please try again later.") and log the HTTP body / socket message at WARN, per the [error-handling convention](../conventions/error-handling.md). Raw Clerk sign-in / TOTP responses are never logged either, even at DEBUG -- they carry the account e-mail and session material.
- **HTTP calls retry transient failures (fix #27)**: `FinaryApiClient.sendWithRetry()` retries up to 3 times with exponential backoff (1s, 2s) on HTTP 5xx and network errors from Clerk/Finary.

## Tests

- `FinaryImportServiceTest` -- xlsx parsing on a real POI workbook, invalid upload, and `executeImport`: MAP_EXISTING updates balance / binds the Finary id on a member-scoped lookup, foreign or provider-synced target rejected with nothing written, CREATE_NEW sets member/balance/external id from the file, SKIP writes nothing, expired token, token previewed by another member, token consumed after use, preview offers only mappable accounts
- `FinaryPersistenceHelperTest` -- snapshot dating (end-of-day rule, several flows on one day, flow dated today, DB variant) and `isMappable`
- `FinaryApiSyncServiceTest` -- unit tests for API sync flow, incl. loans appearing in the preview and being created as LOAN accounts on execute, MAP_EXISTING onto a provider-synced account refused, preview listing only mappable targets
- `FinaryLoanDtoTest` -- unit tests for parsing the `/loans` payload (snake_case + camelCase aliases)
- Manual integration testing with real Finary accounts
